### Instructions
For this project, I used Streamlit to deploy my interactive visualizations. After downloading and unzipping the directory, run the following command in the command line:  
```streamlit run interactive_dashboard.py```   
After running this command, a website window should pop up. If a the web page didn't show up, copy and paste the local url into your browser. Enjoy playing around with the visualizations!

Notes:
1. The annotations for the line graphs of the third visualization failed to show up for some reason, to see how it works properly, open the "interactive_dashboard.ipynb" file with Jupyter Notebook and run the file.
2. Vis1, Vis2, and Vis3 were all coded from scratch using the Python Altair package, whereas for Vis4, I used Tableau ([Link to Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/CommVis_16365073470030/Dashboard8?:language=en-US&:retry=yes&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)).
